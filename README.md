This code was developed for use in SageMath (CoCalc). It's pretty much Python, but a bit of tweaking is necessary to get it to work in Jupyter or another interpreter as a .ipynb file. For example, watch out for use of (^) instead of (\**) for exponentiation.

The first cell you should evaluate is the code block found in Coordinate_generator.sagews. Doing this will allow you to call functions that generate the coordinates of Gaussian integers and primes in the complex plane within a specified norm.
